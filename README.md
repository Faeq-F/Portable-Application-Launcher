# Portable-Application-Launcher
A launcher for portable apps on your usb drive or computer

This launcher is a way of running your portable apps easily, without the need for shortcuts or looking through multiple folders or directories for the executable files.

## Requirements:
 - A computer running Windows 8 or higher
 - A folder hierarchy where the Launcher file is at the root of it and portable apps are at "\Computer-Resources\PortableApps\"
 - Any portable apps being used have their main executable file at the root of their respected folder (e.g. "\Computer-Resources\PortableApps\PortableApp1\PortableApp1.exe")
 - A Windows defender exclusion for the location of the launcher and it's Portable Apps (Add exclusions to any other anti-malware software that is installed on your computer; you do not want the software to mistake the apps for viruses or other malware.)

## Suggestions:
 - Keeping portable applications on a USB drive enables you to use an appication on any computer with ease
 - Setting up a task to run the launcher at startup in Task Scheduler helps ease of use as you won't need to start the program manually
 - The 'Phenomena' fontface was used for a cleaner look to the program. The font is not required but can be downloaded from https://www.fontfabric.com/fonts/phenomena/. (The font does not need to be installed for use, the 'Phenomena-Regular.ttf' file just needs to be placed in the "\Computer-Resources\PortableApps\Launcher\" directory)
